# HTML

HTML5 is the fifth and current major version of the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the markup language used to create web pages. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the first version of HTML5 in 2014, with minor revisions and additions being made since then.

HTML5 introduces a number of new tags and features, including:

- New elements for semantic markup, such as <article>, <aside>, and <header>
- Support for multimedia content, such as audio and video
- Improved support for forms and input controls
- New ways to style web pages with CSS

HTML5 tags are used to structure and format web pages. They can be used to define headings, paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and other elements of a web page. HTML tags can also be used to add style and interactivity to web pages.

Here is a list of some of the most common HTML5 tags and their uses:

# CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, which is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS helps to separate the content from the presentation by defining how the HTML elements should be displayed on the web page.

CSS is used to style web pages, including layout, colors, fonts, and other visual effects. It provides a wide range of features and properties that can be applied to HTML elements to make them more visually appealing and attractive. Some of the popular CSS properties include font-size, color, background-color, margin, padding, border, and many more.

CSS has several benefits over traditional HTML styling methods. First, it provides a clear separation between the content and the presentation, making it easier to maintain and update web pages. Second, it enables the creation of consistent and uniform styles across multiple web pages, improving the overall user experience. Third, it allows for greater control over the layout and design of web pages, resulting in more visually appealing and engaging websites.

CSS is an integral part of modern web development, and it is essential for web designers and developers to have a good understanding of CSS to create effective and engaging web pages. There are many resources available online to learn CSS, including tutorials, blogs, and online courses.

In conclusion, CSS is a powerful tool for styling web pages and creating visually appealing and engaging websites. Its benefits include clear separation of content and presentation, consistency across multiple web pages, and greater control over layout and design. Anyone interested in web development should learn CSS to improve their skills and create better websites.
